>I am going to share some experiences in the process that I study the linear Algebra, it is really excited that I just find a super nice textbook named *Linear Algebra and the Applications*. I really recommend it if you are going to study the linear algebra especially when you are mindless in which book that you should read. 
>>Life tips: Never judge others by your value, learn to accept the diversity, this is what the world looks like. Respect each other!
